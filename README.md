The Forum System is a platform where users can engage in discussions by creating posts, adding comments, and upvoting/downvoting content. The forum is centered around specific topics, fostering community-driven discussions. Users can register, log in, and interact with posts based on their interests. Once logged in users can sort and filter all posts and also update their personal information. Administrators have additional privileges such as managing users, search them by name, username or email and moderating content.
